# WALMART-STORE-SALES-PREDICTION

We are provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. 
Each store contains a number of departments, and our task is to predict the department-wide sales for each store.

In addition, Walmart runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks. 
Part of the challenge presented by this task is to model the effects of markdowns on these holiday weeks in the absence of complete/ideal historical data.
